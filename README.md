Role Registration

    Producers, quality inspectors, distributors, and retailers are registered on-chain by the contract owner.
    Each role has unique permissions.

Product Creation

    A producer creates a product, providing details such as name, batch ID, category, production date, and metadataURI (pointing to IPFS/Arweave for extended data).
    A unique product ID is assigned automatically.

Quality Assurance

    Producers assign quality inspectors.
    Inspectors add certifications and approve product quality.
    Expiry dates and compliance standards are logged immutably.

Ownership Transfer

    Products are transferred step-by-step: producer → distributor → retailer → consumer.


Consumer Trust

    Buyers can verify authenticity, check certifications, and see the product’s journey — all directly from the blockchain.
